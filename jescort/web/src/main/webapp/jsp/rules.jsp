We do not tolerate circumvention of our word filter or abuse upon another member. As stated above, we are a forum for all ages and expect posts to be family / work friendly.<br> <br><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong class="bbc">No Racism, Threatening,  No Victimization or Hateful Posts / Retaliation   </strong></span><br>If you are a long standing member, act like one; lead by example and assist other newer users rather than attacking them. We look upon our veteran users to use this opportunity to teach the newer users the appropriate way to conduct themselves in this community.<br> <br><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong class="bbc">No Personal Attacks or Retaliation </strong></span>  <br>Personal attacks such as instigating "flame bait", verbal abuse, mocking or sexist remarks of members in posts are not tolerated at Jescort. Such posts will be deleted on sight or moderated accordingly.<br>  <br>As above, if you are a long standing member, act like one. Lead by example and assist other newer members rather than attacking them. Members that reply to posts simply to instigate argument will be warned / suspended from forum areas.<br> <br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px;">Post On Topic. </span></strong>  <br>Please post on topic and within the subject area of the subforum. If your topic does not fit, please use our General Discussions area. If you have questions on the correct content area, please PM a moderator.<br>		  <br>Use a title that describes the content of your post. Don't use all caps or special characters to draw attention to your post. This is an English speaking site, and we expect all posts to be in English. Links must resolve to other English speaking sites.<br> <br><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong class="bbc">No Unacceptable Forum or News Comments. </strong></span>  <br>While some members feel that post count is important, there are some posts that we feel do not contribute to the community in any way what-so-ever. If you wish to direct a fellow member to something that has already been posted, please do so in a courteous manner.<br>					  <br>Unacceptable posts include (but are not limited to):<ul class="bbc"><br><li>"old news" or anything similar<br></li><li>"first post" or anything similar<br></li><li>"(insert product or brand) sucks" or anything similar<br></li><li>"I posted this in BPN x days ago!!!" or anything similar<br></li></ul><br><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong class="bbc">Do not post links to exploits, malware, or websites that produce undesired effects to our members.</strong></span><br>This includes browser crashes, multiple pop-up screens, DOS attacks, or similar results. Links will be removed, threads closed, and members will be warned or suspended.<br> <br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px;">No Avatar &amp; Custom Title Abuse.   </span></strong><br>These are a site courtesy and abuse of them will result in them being lost and your account being restricted. We also have Sig Guidelines that outline what image (type, dimensions &amp; file size) we find acceptable <strong class="bbc"><a title="" class="bbc_url" href="/">click here to view</a></strong>.<br> <br><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong class="bbc">Jescort Is Not A Support Forum For Other Sites. </strong></span>  <br>Comparing, judging the content/value or raising the opinion of other sites, recruiting members or staff, bad mouthing (or victimizing) &amp; negative discussion about non/affiliate site issues on our forums is neither wanted nor tolerated. Promotion of individual member sites or blogs will be deleted on sight.<br> <br><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong class="bbc">No Spamming</strong></span>.  <br>Spamming is characterized by the initiation of threads or posts that contribute nothing to a forum, be it off topic or on topic. Examples include: empty bodies, bodies with few words that have no relation to the current thread or discussion and those posts that state they are spam, either to annoy, advertise or increase a member's post count. Users may not use news item comments to advertise or promote another product. Resurrecting old forum posts is also not appreciated unless it serves a worthy cause to the forum. This determination is made by the forum Moderator or Administrator and is not up for discussion.		  <br> <br>Forum signatures are to be used respectfully, Jescort already has to display ads to cover the running costs, so don't annoy our members by making your signature into your personal ad revenue opportunity.<br> <br><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong class="bbc">Advertisement Blocking. </strong></span>  <br>Glorifying the fact in posts here on Jescort is <strong class="bbc">strictly forbidden</strong>. We understand that some members could not care less to display advertisements on any website, and therefore block a stream of revenue that is required to keep this site running. We can not do much about that but please do not glorify the fact.<br> <br>We have a subscription package that professionally removes all advertisements from Jescort for a small annual fee. We never ask members to click advertisements, and for those that do; we greatly appreciate this. Simply allowing the advertisement to load (without clicking on it) also returns revenue for the site. If you feel that you can not whitelist Jescort or afford the subscription but would like to contribute, you are very welcome to donate via PayPal to subscribe@jescort.net and make a post here.<br> <br><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong class="bbc">Respect Moderator Decisions. </strong></span>  <br>Threads and posts questioning the actions or decisions of forum moderations will be deleted on sight, and the appropriate action taken (up to and including forum bans) against the thread starter and/or participants. However, as a member you reserve the right to PM any moderator, supervisor or administrator regarding action taken at Jescort.<br> <br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px;">Use the Jescort Reporting System Properly.</span></strong>  <br>Do not abuse the report system. While we appreciate members reporting bad behavior, or posts, please do not use this system to post rude comments or retaliate against other members. Reported posts will be handled as soon as possible.<br> <br><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong class="bbc">No Alternate (Dupe) Accounts</strong></span>.  <br>Should you be disciplined with a restriction or ban, you are not allowed to open a new account to obtain freedom to post. Restrictions and bans are given for a reason, and usurping that ability by re-registering is not tolerated. If another account is opened, that account will be banned immediately, and the original account will be further penalized. Anyone who has warnings on their account is automatically excluded from changing their user name.<br> <br><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong class="bbc">Jescort reserves the right to change or alter these rules at any time and an Administrator's word is final.</strong></span><br> <br>Note: Any infraction of these guidelines will result in a warning being placed against your Jescort account.
